# Hennin

Hennin is a classic Snood clone puzzle game. Written in Lua and using
the LÖVE 2D framework, Hennin works on Linux, Windows or OSX. It's still
very much a work in progress, so don't expect a lot, but it is playable.

## How do I run this thing?
At some point I will have full builds of the game available, but until
the game is polished enough the only way to play will be to run it
manually.

### Linux
Install the LÖVE framework, clone the repository, cd into its directory and run this command:

    $ love .

### Windows and OSX
Follow these instructions: http://www.love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started

## I'd like to help, what can I do?
Choose an item from the ToDo list (TODO.md file), create an issue for it
and let everyone know you're working on it. Create a pull request and
I'll merge it after I take a look. Please make sure your code works
before creating a pull request.

## IRC channel
Feel free to join #hennin on freenode, but don't expect an instant response :)
